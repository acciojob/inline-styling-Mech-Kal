            Flowers are the reproductive structures found in flowering plants (angiosperms). They often display vibrant colors and pleasant scents to attract pollinators like insects and birds. They are essential for producing seeds and fruits, which allow the plant species to propagate. [Image of a variety of colorful flowers]
